# Data Structures and Algorithms

::: tip TODO
- Retouch
:::

This repo follows the topics of the following courses for students of [Laurea triennale in Informatica](https://www.unive.it/pag/3/)
at [Universit√† Ca' Foscari di Venezia](https://www.unive.it/):

* [Mod. 1](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339889)
* [Mod. 2](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339890)

Anyhow, I took the liberty of adding extra content for a better comprehension of the course.
Eventually this project will be extended to include advanced data structures and algorithms.

## General Theory

* Asymptotic notions
* Temporal and Spatial Complexity
* Solving occurrences
* Decision Problems and NP-Hardness

## Data Structures

I will include the following data structures, their primitives, and some of their declinations:

* Trees
* Heap
* Priority Queues
* Tables
* Graphs

I do not include (for now), some basilar data structures and their implementations such as:

* Sets
* Array
* Stack
* Queues
* Lists and their declinations.

## Algorithms

I will try and implement the algorithms to make immediately runnable.

* Sorting
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms

## Implementation

The implementation technique will be done in C++/C

### Credits

I do not take any credit for the contents, which are taken from my professors, the textbooks and external sources:

* Professor [Alessandra Raffaeta'](https://www.unive.it/data/persone/5591966) and [Marcello Pelillo](https://www.unive.it/data/persone/5592849)
* [DFI] C. Demetrescu, I. Finocchi, G.F. Italiano. Algoritmi e strutture dati. Seconda Edizione. McGraw-Hill, 2008.
* [CLRS] T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest, C. Stein. Introduction to algorithms 3/ed. McGraw-Hill, 2010.
  * Solutions to CLRS exercise:
    * [Solutions to Introduction to Algorithms Third Edition](https://walkccc.me/CLRS/)
    * [Andrew Lohr's Solutions to CLRS](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html)
* Students of Ca' Foscari.
  * Pareschi Chiara
  * Femia Bertacco Giacomo
  * Grazioso Matteo
  * D'Attero Andrea
  * Bertazzon Alice
  * Simonato Niccolo'
  * Scapin Filippo
  * Campanelli Alessio
  * Zanin Alessandro

We will add specific sections to give credit when due, but we recommend to buy the books and follow a university level course
in order to understand these concepts better.

If you feel like any of the content is yours and/or should be removed, please contact me immediately.

#### Shout to helpful resources

I must mention a couple of resources which I found useful:
