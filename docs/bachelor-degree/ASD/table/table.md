# Table

A table is a sequence of elements **E**i, where *i* is the index, where each element is composed of:

* A key: *K*i
  * It is a group of bits or chars that identify a "slot"
* Info: *I*i
  * The information contained in the slot

The objective of the table is to memorize the info Ii, while the key is used to locate the information
from the outside.
