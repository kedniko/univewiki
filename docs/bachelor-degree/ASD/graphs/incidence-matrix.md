# Incidence Matrix

For this implementation we use a **matrix** $n \times m = |V| \times |E|$

* $n$ rows, representing the vertices
* $m$ columns, representing the edges
  * For every column $j$, we put a $1$ in the row $i$ corresponding to the vertices
  connected by edge represented by the column $j$ (ex: $e_{1}$)

Example: this undirected graph right here, would be implemented like this

![ex un Matrix ML](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exUnmatrixIM.png?raw=TRUE)

All the columns are different from each other, since they represent different kind of
information.

In the case we face a directed graph:

* $-1$ if the edge is **incident** from/ leaves vertex $u$,
* $+1$ if the edge is **incident** to/ enters vertex $v$.

### Conclusions

Best for sparse graphs
