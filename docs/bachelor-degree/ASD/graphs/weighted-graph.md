# Weighted Graphs

Weighted graphs are graphs $G(V,E, w)$ where $w$ is a weight function that
can be associated with vertices, edges or both.

For this reason we can derive three types of weighted graphs

* Graphs weighted on vertices
* Graphs weighted on edges
* Graphs weighted on vertices and edges

However, the **weight changes its meaning based on the problem we face**.

## Vertex-Weighted

Graphs for which each **vertex has an associated weight**, given by the weight function
$w : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ which returns a real number

It is best to use an adjacency list and save the weight info for each vertex, inside the main
vector and the linked list for each different vertex

## Edge-Weighted

Graphs for which each **edge has an associated weight**, given by the weight function
$w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ which returns a real number

## Implementations

Using an adjacency list:

* Vertex-Weighted Graphs: It is best to save the weight info for each vertex, inside the **main
vector**.
* Edge-Weighted Graphs: It is best to save the weight info for each edge, as an additional field inside each
element of the linked list

Using an adjacency matrix:

* Vertex-Weighted Graphs: Using the main diagonal for the weights associated with the vertices and
leaving the rest with $0$s or $\infty$
* Edge-Weighted Graphs: Instead of having 1s, we would put the weight of the edge in the right
position and instead of having $0$s, we would use something like $\infty$
