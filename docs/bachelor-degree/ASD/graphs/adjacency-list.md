# Adjacency List

For this implementation

* We use a **vector** $Adj[]$, of length $|V| = n$.
* Each cell $Adj[u]$, $\forall u \in V$.
  * Is **labeled** in a way that reflects the given graph
  * Contains a pointer to a linked list, where each element of the list represents
  a vertex $v \in V$ adjacent to $u$, such that $(u,v) \in E$
    * Those elements are labeled too.

Furthermore

* For vertex-weighted graphs, $Adj[u]$ also contains the weight $w(u)$
* For edge-weighted graphs, each element of the linked list has additional information for the weight $w(u)$

Example: this graph right here, would be implemented like this

## Space

| Case          | Space $S(n)$                                             |
|-------------- |--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sparse Graph  | $S(n) = \mathcal{O} (\|V\|+\|E\|) = \mathcal{O} (n+m)$   |
| Dense Graph   | $S(n) = \mathcal{O} (n^{2})$                             |

## Time

Verifying adjacency in the case of a long linked-list, takes more time.

### Conclusions

Because the adjacency-list representation provides a compact way to represent sparse graphs, it is usually the method
of choice.

| **Pros**                                                    | **Cons**                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------ |-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Best for sparse graphs                                      | Worst for dense graphs                                        |
| Space complexity is not fixed to $\Theta(n^{2})$            | Can worsen with dense graphs and large $n$                    |
| Flexible structure for both undirected and directed graphs  | Verifying adjacency when the lists are long, takes more time  |
