# ADVANCED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

[[toc]]

## METADATA

Why take this course:

- it will be fun
- you'll learn amazing programming techniques
- you'll be exposed to some of the most fascinating pieces of computer science theory

Bacically this course is to convince you that functional programming is better than imperative programming.


## EXAM

Written test. (and then a bonus project if we want, we can propose the project)

## Materials

Books:

- [Programming in scala (Odersky)](https://www.amazon.it/Programming-Scala-Fifth-Martin-Odersky/dp/0997148004)
- [Functional programming in scala (Chiusano)](https://www.amazon.it/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653)
