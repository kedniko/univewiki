# First concepts

## Statistical learning

A set of statistical tools for understanding and making sense of complex datasets.
Classified as:

- **supervised learning**: goal is to predict an output based on one or more inputs (response).
- ~~**unsupervised learning**: no outcome measure, goal is describe associations and patterns among a set of inputs.~~

> **Statical learning vs machine learning**
> Statical learning: more focused on models and interpretations of results
> Machine learning: more focused on accurate predictio, despite possible lack of clear interpretation.
> There is a lot of overlap between the two fields.
