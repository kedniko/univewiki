## What is artificial intelligence?

No universally accepted definition. AI is the endeavor of building intelligent artifact.

- ability to learn
- faculty of good sense, to adapt to circumstances
- ability to perform well in an intellingence test
- branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers
- program that can sense, reason, act and adapt
- pass the turing test (the imitation game)

> Mimicking human behavior

Weak AI: can a machine exhibit intelligent behavior?
Strong AI: can a machine be self-aware?

### Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning  (AI vs ML vs DL)

**AI**: A program that can sense, reason, act and adapt
**ML**: Algorithms whose performance improve with experience as they are exposed to more data over time
**DL**: Subset of ML in which multi-layered neural networks learn from vast amounts of data
