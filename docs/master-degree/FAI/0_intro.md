No, can just read the slides

No recording. He will republish the old ones.

## EXAM

We must use Python.

Two ways:

1. 3 Assignments (individual or max 2) during the semester with deadlines (you can't skip one assignment). We will have 2/3 weeks. The deadline of the last assignment is september on the next year (just to give use more freedom). (ie in short:  november, december, september)
2. Project with oral discussion (in group is ok) (we can choose the topic if we want).

## Materials

We will strictly follow the slides.
